# Regression Housing Price Prediction
A machine learning project to predict housing prices based on various features.
# Description
This project focuses on building and evaluating regression models to predict the prices of houses based on a variety of features, such as size, location, and number of bedrooms. Accurate price predictions can benefit real estate agencies, homeowners, and buyers by providing a data-driven valuation of properties.

The dataset includes information on properties such as lot size, number of rooms, age of the house, and other relevant factors that influence house prices.
# Features
Preprocessing of data, including handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

Implementation of multiple regression algorithms:
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Ridge
  3. Lasso
  4. Elastic Net

Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.

Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² score.
# Dataset
Independent Variables:
  1. City
  2. House Area (sqm)
  3. No. of Bedrooms
  4. No. of toilets
  5. Stories
  6. Renovation Status

Target variable:
  1. Price ($)

# Results
Best model - Ridge because of the values (can be seen in notebook)
